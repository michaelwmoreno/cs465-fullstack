CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN


Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Express HTML is used with Express.js for server-side rendering, while JavaScript is used for client-side scripting. Single-page applications (SPAs) rely on JavaScript to dynamically update the content without refreshing the entire page, providing a smoother user experience.
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, making it suitable for projects where data schemas may evolve over time, as in the case of rapid prototyping or early-stage development.

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data interchange format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON is often used to transmit data between the frontend and backend of a web application due to its simplicity and compatibility with JavaScript, allowing for easy parsing and manipulation.
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
Refactoring code to create reusable UI components can improve maintainability and efficiency by reducing code duplication and promoting consistency across the application. For example, creating a reusable navigation bar component that can be used on multiple pages simplifies development and ensures uniformity in the user interface.

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Methods in API testing refer to HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE used to interact with endpoints, which are specific URLs that the API exposes for clients to access. Testing involves verifying that these endpoints respond correctly to different methods and handle data securely, especially when dealing with sensitive information.

Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has provided me with a solid understanding of full stack development, including frontend and backend technologies, API development, and database management. I've gained proficiency in languages like JavaScript, frameworks like Express.js, and database systems like MongoDB, making me a more well-rounded and marketable candidate in the field of web development.
